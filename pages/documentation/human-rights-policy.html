            <h1>Human Rights Policy</h1>
            
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>Triops Technologies SAS, along with our subsidiaries (collectively, "Triops"), have been committed to defending human rights since our founding. We affirm the right of all people to protection under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and seek to share our founding commitment to respect privacy, civil liberties, and other fundamental rights wherever we work.</p>
            <p>This policy applies to Triops's global business operations. Specifically, the commitments contained in this policy apply to all Triops officers, directors, employees, contractors, and consultants.</p>
            <p>Triops recognizes the role we play in helping some of the world’s most important public, private, and non-profit institutions. We were founded with the goal to enable Western democracies and open societies to harness data in better protecting their citizens without compromising the civil liberties of the people they seek to protect. Our business is focused on commercial, governmental, and non-profit entities across defense, intelligence, healthcare, and other industries. Along with our growth, our core commitment to privacy and civil liberties — cornerstones of human rights — remains central to our identity. Human rights due diligence for Triops customers and suppliers are also addressed in the Partner Expectations section of this policy.</p>

            <h2>Triops's Human Rights Policy</h2>
            <p>Triops acknowledges its corporate responsibility to endeavor to protect human rights and supports the principles outlined in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (the “UDHR”), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the human rights guidance set forth in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.</p>
            <p>As most relevant to Triops’s business, we particularly support the global fundamental rights to security (UDHR Article 3), privacy (UDHR Article 12), and entitlement to rights and freedoms without distinction (UDHR Article 2), and we embrace our responsibility to uphold these values in our work. These rights have been essential to our mission since the company was founded — driving our focus on privacy, civil liberties, and security as core values of our business and products.</p>
            <p>Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of human rights, and we believe it is essential to our mission to assist in its eradication. At Triops, we are committed to adopting policies and practices that aim to eliminate any slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business. Though we believe the direct risks of such practices within our business are very low, we take measures to enable our business and supply chain to be slavery-free and review our workplace policies and procedures to assess their effectiveness in identifying and tackling modern slavery issues.</p>
            <p>Triops supports the right of access to remedy for those impacted by adverse human rights actions. We are committed to striving to mitigate the risk of misuse of our products through a number of means, as detailed in the Partner Expectations section of this policy.</p>
            <p>We pride ourselves on an internal culture in which concerns and questions are encouraged and voiced openly by all levels of employees. Triops’s policies, including our Code of Conduct, lay out methods by which employees, contractors, and consultants can voice questions on ethical or legal conduct, either directly or anonymously. Retaliatory actions against anyone who in good faith voices concerns over possible violations are strictly prohibited.</p>
            <p>Triops will continue to engage with the international community on human rights thought leadership. This has been a longstanding pillar of Triops, ranging from our engagement on data protection, privacy, and civil liberties in technology to contributions on the thoughtful development of Artificial Intelligence. We will seek out specific avenues of external engagement on human rights issues to share our expertise and learn from other companies, individuals, and organizations.</p>

            <h2>Triops's Mission and Values</h2>
            <p>Triops partners with some of the most important governments, public institutions, non-profits, and commercial entities around the world in solving highly nuanced institutional challenges. The nature of our work, combined with our commitments to the security and confidentiality of our customers, imposes formal and legal limits on our capacity to explain specific details of our work. We recognize that in helping our customers address crucial data-dependent challenges, there will naturally be concern over the appropriate use of data to achieve positive outcomes.</p>
            <p>At Triops, we believe that working to protect fundamental human rights requires engagement, including engagement with the institutions whose vital tasks exist in tension with certain human rights. We believe we best uphold our commitment to secure human rights by enabling and supporting properly functioning global institutions. As a responsible corporate citizen, we must not only assess our work for any potential negative human rights impact but also work to promote the positive role that our software can play in protecting vulnerable populations and promoting the functioning of legitimate institutions.</p>
            <p>Additionally, we recognize the complexity of human rights and the potential for certain rights to exist in tension with each other. We recognize the nuance involved in certain areas where core human rights tenets such as security and privacy have the potential to conflict. By embracing this nuance, we ensure that these tensions do not become mutually exclusive and allow for institutions to further their difficult but important missions. Even in doing so, we will continue to incorporate privacy and civil liberties as fundamental components of our products and approach.</p>

            <h2>Incorporation of Human Rights into Triops's Business</h2>
            <p>Organizationally, human rights due diligence is part of Triops’s internal structure, particularly within our legal and compliance teams. Comprised of lawyers, engineers, and social scientists, these teams focus on proactively incorporating privacy, ethics, and human rights principles directly into the products we offer and the opportunities Triops pursues, as well as fostering a culture of responsibility around the development and use of our products. This company approach directly maps to human rights and civil liberties principles through the promotion of “privacy by design,” system accountability, and oversight where our products are deployed. Additionally, Triops believes that any decision which could significantly affect individuals’ rights should not be left solely to machines, and that understanding potential effects on fundamental rights should involve a careful examination of whether the technology is appropriate or necessary for the problem at hand.</p>
            <p>Triops also incorporates human rights into our business through advisory consultations with independent, international experts in privacy law, civil liberties in tech, policy, and ethics who help us understand and address the complex issues we encounter in our work.</p>
            <p>Finally, Triops furthers the field of human rights through our commercial partnerships with humanitarian organizations whose dedicated missions focus on preserving and improving rights to safety, freedom from hunger and slavery, and other core values of the UDHR.</p>

            <h2>Partner Expectations</h2>
            <p>Triops is a software company that builds data management, analysis, and operationalization infrastructure for our customers. Importantly, this means that our customers are the legal owners of their data. With the exception of information related to personnel management and other necessary internal business practices, Triops does not own, collect, store, or sell personal data. We help our customers, many of them major public institutions, advance their mission objectives by leveraging our software. As noted in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, this introduces complexity into the human rights-related actions of our customers. Triops actively considers these factors in our customer relationships.</p>
            <p>We expect all our customers to respect human rights while recognizing that they are themselves entities with rights and that they often operate in highly complex spheres.</p>
            <p>Additionally, there are legal, ethical, and privacy limitations around our ability to actively monitor all customer actions or leverage data they legally own within Triops products. We believe the best defenses against customers and third parties using our products for outcomes with adverse human rights impacts are to incorporate privacy and security as building blocks of our products and proactively vet risk ahead of engagement. For more on our expectations of suppliers, please see our Supplier Code of Conduct.</p>
            <p>With this in mind, we approach mitigating risk in our customers via four distinct means:</p>
            <ul class="simple-list" style="columns: 1;">
                <li><b>Incorporating privacy-by-design into Triops products:</b> Security and privacy are core product considerations in everything we build. We create product features that continually remind customer users of their obligations, as well as workflows that maximize transparency and auditability for customer data protection officers.</li>
                <li><b>Proactive risk scoping of customers before work begins:</b> We believe the best risk defense is a firm understanding of the customers with whom we work. We have specific criteria for industries we will work in, countries where we will not operate, and limitations on the capabilities we will build. We have walked away from opportunities where we were not comfortable with the work being done.</li>
                <li><b>Thoughtful review of new product use cases:</b> Privacy, ethics, and civil liberty engineering is a core responsibility of all Triops employees. All employees are trained on their privacy, security, and ethical obligations during onboarding and for specific customer engagements. We take this expectation seriously and examine the risks and potential impacts of new product use cases with existing customers.</li>
                <li><b>Reactively addressing concerns around third-party use of Triops products:</b> Triops identifies an ever-present responsibility to strive to ensure that our software is used for good. Where we are made aware of claims of misuse of our products, we will explore using every means at our disposal, including but not limited to contract provisions, cooperation with investigatory and judicial bodies, and termination of customer relationships.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Raise Concerns</h2>
            <p>Triops has embraced an open internal culture and the ability to directly voice all questions or challenges around our work. As the right to remedy is a pillar of human rights due diligence, our Company Code of Conduct details the ways in which Triops officers, directors, employees, contractors, and consultants are encouraged to voice questions on ethical or legal conduct. Triops strictly prohibits retaliatory action against anyone who, in good faith, reports a potential code violation.</p>
            <p>Specifically, our officers, directors, employees, contractors, and consultants can raise complaints internally via the following means:</p>
            <ul class="simple-list">
                <li>Using our confidential ethics hotline or in direct communication with Triops's Legal, Compliance, and Data Protection teams.</li>
                <li>Anonymously via our Whistleblower Hotline, hosted by a third-party provider.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As an external, impacted party, you can report human rights concerns via: humanrights@3ops.tech.</p>
            <p>Triops commits to reviewing the validity of human rights concerns and, where appropriate, taking subsequent action to mitigate adverse human rights impacts.</p>
